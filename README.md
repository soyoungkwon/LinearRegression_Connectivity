# LinearRegression_Connectivity
Linear Fit of the fMRI connectivity data

# # Aim
# A linear regression analysis is applied to check whether visual network (VIS) and Dorsal Attention Network (DAN) or Default Mode Network (DMN) are hierarchically connected to each other.
# # Data analysis order
# 1. Load all the data (connectivity during attention and resting) : connAtten, connRest in 01_DataConnectivity
# 2. Extract only necessary part of the data and reorganize it
#  (connectivity between DAN-VIS, DMN-VIS)
# 3. Linear regression fit : gain, base will be obtained
# 4. Visualize the Linear Regression plot
# 5. Visualize the Gain, Base (as a bar plot)
